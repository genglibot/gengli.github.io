I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EE](https://www.ee.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm). My research interest includes Robotics, 3D vision, point cloud registration and learning-based motion planning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhe Min](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yRbCUW8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) of SDSR Lab from [School of Control Science](https://control.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University.
